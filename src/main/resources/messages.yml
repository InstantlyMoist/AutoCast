# Important information:
# In order to disable something, replace the list like:
# Text:
#   - 'Text here'
# With
# Text: []
#
# In order to create more message, you will need to copy paste the old message, and change it to your likings. If you wish to create an empty message.
# execute the command /autocast create (name) and this will create an empty message for you.
#
# In order to create a proper book, you will need to use: https://minecraftjson.com/
# Not sure how this works? Make sure to check out the plugin page for more information!
#
# In order to set the bossbar color change the first word with the color, followed by a semicolon:
# COLOR;TEXT
#
# If it's somehow still unclear how to set up a proper message for your own server, don't hesitate to contact me.
# You can PM me on Spigot: https://www.spigotmc.org/members/kyllian.31777/
# Or join my discord server for further assistance: https://discord.gg/zgKr2YM
#
# In order to get multiple lines in a hover message, put \n in the place where you'd like a new line to begin
# This also counts for the MOTD
#
# Enjoy <3
